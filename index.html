             <h3 id="activity-1">The Devils Punchbowl!</h3> 
             <p class="img-para1">A rare and amazing underground spring in the middle of the only true Desert in Manitoba. Sand left over from ancient rivers and lakes creates a landscape with cactus you would only find in a Desert, surrounded by prairie features mixed in, a beautiful hike with ton's of opportunity to learn.</p>
            
             <div><img src="images/download.jpg" alt="Winnipeg Jets Logo" id="jets"></div>
             <h3 id="activity-2">Winnipeg Jets!</h3>
             <p class="img-para2">Make your way to the peak of Hockey performance, the Winnipeg Jets are wildly entertaining, and have been incredibly competitive for the Stanley Cup in recent years! Grab a beer and cheer for the White Out!</p>
            
             <div><img src="images/Snowmobile.jpg" alt="Skidoo at sunset ripping through the snow" id="skidoo"></div>
             <h3 id="activity-3">Snow Machines!</h3>
             <p class="img-para3"> Let's face it. Manitoba is <em>COLD!</em> For more than half of the year the activities available for fun are in the cold! Skiing, skating, sledding on a hill and the most fun of all, hoping on a Skidoo and blazing down a trail, hopefully you have heated handlebars!</p>
